# ML Trading Optimizer

This project focuses on optimizing financial trading strategies using machine learning techniques. It serves as a learning platform to explore the integration of machine learning models with common trading strategies to enhance their performance.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains modules for data retrieval and preprocessing.
- `strategies/`: Implements various trading strategies.
- `models/`: Includes machine learning models for optimizing trading strategies.
- `backtester.py`: A script to evaluate the performance of trading strategies using historical data.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/noahd223/ml-trading-optimizer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd ml-trading-optimizer
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the necessary packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

**Backtesting**:

   Evaluate the performance of the trading strategy using the `backtester.py` script:

   ```bash
   python backtester.py
   ```

   This will output performance metrics and visualizations comparing the strategy's returns against a benchmark (S&P 500 buy and hold)
